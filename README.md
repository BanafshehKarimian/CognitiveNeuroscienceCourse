# CognitiveNeuroscienceCourse
In this repository the projects that I have done for the cognitive neuroscience course are presented.
### Project1
In this project, we design a test in order to investigate spatial heterogeneity in face perception and analyze whether the location of the stimuli has influence on detecting the gender using Psychophysics Toolbox. In the second phase, we first cleaned the data and added required columns and then exploed data through plotting multiple bar charts. After that, we used multivariable linear regression to predict behavioural characteristics. We plotted psychometric function per subject next, and calculated PSE (point of subjective equivalende) per visual field, per location and per ecc (eccentricity). We observed that: 1) the response time is smaller for the first visual field. 
### Project2
In this project we implemented morris lecar, Hodgkin Huxley, LIF and WilsonCowan models that describe the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons.
### Project3
In this peoject the paper "Najar A, Bonnet E, Bahrami B, Palminteri S. The actions of others act as a pseudo-reward to drive imitation in the context of social reinforcement learning. PLoS Biol. 2020 Dec 8;18(12):e3001028. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001028. PMID: 33290387; PMCID: PMC7723279." is implemented.
